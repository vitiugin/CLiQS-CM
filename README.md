An Abstractive Approach Using Transformers



## Data

Folder **data** includes **tweets** collected during five events and **reports** provided by ERCC. Every file in folder **tweets** (inside event directories) contains columns with tweet *ids*, *labels* (informative crisis [1] /non-crisis [0] and in some files non-informative crisis [2]), and *categories* ([1] - tweet labeled as category related). Folders inside **reports** include crisis-related .pdf files downloaded from [ERCC Echo Flash](https://erccportal.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ECHO-Products/Echo-Flash#/echo-flash-items/latest) and text reports used as ground truth during summaries evaluation.
